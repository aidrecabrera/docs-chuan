# Customers

To store information about customers, we can create a Customers table with fields for the specified information.

- Customers Table: This table stores information about each customer.
    - CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
    - FirstName: The first name of the customer.
    - LastName: The last name of the customer.
    - PhoneNumber: The phone number of the customer.
    - Note: Additional notes about the customer (private and internal).
    - Location: The location where the customer is associated. This field is assumed to be a string for simplicity.

The admin and staff will be able to import, save, and view customers. These are the information when they add a new customer:

## Customer Overview
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone Number
- Note (Notes are private and won't be shared with the customer.)
- Location (What location they are.)
